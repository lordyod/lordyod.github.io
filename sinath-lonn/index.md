# Sinath Lonn


This is a science fantasy campaign set in a homebrew world, run using a hacked
version of 5th Edition D\&D.

The current party:

* Brisby, a halfling/goblin cleric from the mountains of the Mashioque Dynasty.
    They were raised by their adopted Dragonborn family and are not aware of
    their goblin heritage. They are a cleric of law and order, and are seeking
    their life's purpose.
* Zo-zu, a human/goblin artificer from the Empire of Corus. A member of the
    Corus army, he's been deployed as part of the peacekeeping forces to the
    area and serves as the connection to the party's primary patron.
* Greta, a dwarf investigator from the Free Cities of Mihira. A middle-aged
    woman with a family back home, she is wandering the world in search of her
    long-lost brother.
* Magdrek, a bugbear barbarian from the Ellisdeen Wilds in western Eryssia. A
    follower of Hruggek, the patron of violence, he believes in might being
    right and the value of proving your point physically.

Previous party members:

* Lein, a tortle monk from Glaeyd Strium, died from a derro hook spear to the
    head while pacifying a temple to Bha'al.
* Ashal, a leonin fighter from the plains of the Mashioque Dynasty, died when
    overrun by angry blights animated to defend the Ellisdeen Wilds.

The party has been on a quest to retrieve a mysterious artifact, the _Heart of
the Forest_, and return it to its rightful place in the far northeast part of
the Ellisdeen Wilds. In our most recent session they have found the temple to
return the heart, only to discover it is some kind of ancient technology. They
attempted to replace the heart in its sarcophagus but failed to realize that the
apparatus had been damaged when it was stolen. This caused the replacement to go
awry and the installation defenses triggered. One of the bugbear allies stayed
behind to buy the party time to escape, and we have not yet seen the fallout of
this.
