# The Gods of Sinath Lonn


One of the major differences between traditional D&D and my science fantasy
homebrew setting is the nature of divine magic. A big part of this is the
relationship between mortals and the gods. In settings such as the Forgotten
Realms or Greyhawk, divine magic comes from the gods themselves. That isn't
the case in Sinath Lonn.

There are basically two types of gods in this world. The first are patron gods,
and they are typically concerned with an individual race such as elves or orcs.
The second are greater gods, who get involved in things that they care about in
somewhat fickle and inconsistent ways.

{{<admonition>}} I've obviously lifted all of these straight out of existing
settings. So far in the campaign the gods' involvement has been pretty low, so
there's still plenty of time to rectify this. I'm planning on going through and
recreating the pantheon using some generator tools, such as those provided Kevin
Crawford at [Sine Nomine](http://www.sinenomine-pub.com/).{{</admonition>}}

## Patron Gods

These gods are a bit more consistent than the greater gods in that they care
about their individual races. They get involved in the mortal world generally
only when really momentous events effect their flocks, or when they sense an
opportunity to expand their base of power or sphere of influence.

## Greater Gods

Unlike patron gods, the greater gods aren't really all that interested in the
affairs of individual mortals without some compelling reason. Instead they care
about particular ideals or purposes which are filled by many creatures,
humanoids or monsters. There have been some cults to these gods over the years
and perhaps a few of them have had some effect. More often, the plots and
conflicts of the greater gods have some overall effect on the mortal realm.

## Servants, agents, and envoys

The gods themselves aren't seen in the world (at least, not in a way that
doesn't strike people as 'holy shit what is this crazy person talking about')
but their servants definitely are. It is believed that magical/supernatural/etc
creatures such as elementals, fey, celestials, fiends, and monstrosities are
chosen as servants of one god or another to fulfill tasks (either general or
specific). People who are particularly observant of religious practices might
balk at interfering with such creatures without some careful thought.
