# Beatrix the Monolith


Beatrix is a half-orc Gray Watchman Warden. In the Radiant Gaia setting,
half-orcs are raised on stories of the heroism and valor of their orc ancestors,
and Beatrix aspires to this. She believes strongly in the value of law and
order, and had a promising career in the city watch before she had to give it up
in order to pay off a gambling debt her lousy brother had built up.

She is a competent warrior who focuses on utilizing her strong defense to
protect other members of the party, keeping the enemy off balance and focused on
her.
