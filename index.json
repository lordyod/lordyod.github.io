[{"categories":["rpg"],"content":"Beatrix is a half-orc Gray Watchman Warden. In the Radiant Gaia setting, half-orcs are raised on stories of the heroism and valor of their orc ancestors, and Beatrix aspires to this. She believes strongly in the value of law and order, and had a promising career in the city watch before she had to give it up in order to pay off a gambling debt her lousy brother had built up. She is a competent warrior who focuses on utilizing her strong defense to protect other members of the party, keeping the enemy off balance and focused on her.

I’m starting this blog to share some thoughts on my interests. This will probably be limited mostly to gaming and tech since those are the things I generally feel the safest sharing with others, but who knows? A bit about me: I’m a cis white 18-49 American. My pronouns are he/him/his. I consider myself on the far left side of the political spectrum. I plan to use this site to chat about my hobbies: I’ve been playing and running various RPG’s since the 90s. Mostly this has been D\u0026D/Pathfinder, but I have also enjoyed (in no particular order) Traveller, World of Darkness, Brave New World, GURPS, and a litany of other games. More recently I’ve been digging into the OSR and am starting an Old School Essentials game. I play video games also. My steam library is extensive. I tend to refrain from competitive multiplayer games and usually enjoy CRPG’s, strategy, and narrative-first games, although a decade or so ago I played a lot of Battlefield. I watch a fair amount of TV and movies and might talk about them. I like tech and enjoy setting up a relatively sophisticated home network. I try to self-host anything I can and intend to share some of what I’ve learned. Things you won’t find here: Support for cops, Nazis, or gender roles.
