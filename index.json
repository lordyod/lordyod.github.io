Hugo automatically generates meta pages for tags and categories, which we‚Äôll see later. slug: allows you to override the URL, if this is not set then the filename is used. categories: like tags, allows you to have Hugo organize the post in a generated meta list.

This will probably be limited mostly to gaming and tech since those are the things I generally feel the safest sharing with others, but who knows? A bit about me: I‚Äôm a cis white 18-49 American. My pronouns are he/him/his. I consider myself on the far left side of the political spectrum. I plan to use this site to chat about my hobbies: I‚Äôve been playing and running various RPG‚Äôs since the 90s. Mostly this has been D\u0026D/Pathfinder, but I have also enjoyed (in no particular order) Traveller, World of Darkness, Brave New World, GURPS, and a litany of other games. More recently I‚Äôve been digging into the OSR and am starting an Old School Essentials game. I play video games also. My steam library is extensive. I tend to refrain from competitive multiplayer games and usually enjoy CRPG‚Äôs, strategy, and narrative-first games, although a decade or so ago I played a lot of Battlefield. I watch a fair amount of TV and movies and might talk about them. I like tech and enjoy setting up a relatively sophisticated home network. I try to self-host anything I can and intend to share some of what I‚Äôve learned. Things you won‚Äôt find here: Support for cops, Nazis, or gender roles.
