We’re playing using Discord and Roll20, which I’ve had experience with and it’s certainly good enough to have plenty of fun with. We’re going to try to play weekly with short sessions so we should be able to keep the pacing fast and interest levels high.

The Investigators In Call of Cthulhu the PC’s are typically ‘investigators’ rather than ‘adventurers’ or heroes or what-have-you. Instead of being career soldiers or knights or whatever you are much more likely to be a graduate student or a reporter. This of course follows from Lovecraft’s work1, in which many of the main characters are academics or journalists who have stumbled upon some evidence of the greater world we don’t know about and have decided to investigate. This campaign comes with a number of pre-generated characters. Since this is the first experience most of us have had with Call of Cthulhu we decided to just pick from among them and get into it quickly.2 I have always wanted to play the role of the curious professor in a cosmic horror story so I chose to play Johan Braun.

Rendezvous in Lima Each of the investigators had independently learned of a rich American explorer assembling an expedition to explore an ancient pyramid in southern Peru, and (mostly for curiousity) we had each decided to sign on. We met Mr. Larkin at the Bar Cardenas in Lima, Peru in the evening of March 18th, 1921 to discuss the expedition and make plans for the journey. Wearing a fine linen suit and bearing an upbeat, confident manner, Larkin told us a tall tale of an ancient pyramid structure in the Peruvian highlands to the southeast. Accompanying Larkin were two other men who had signed on to the journey. Luis de Mendoza was clearly Larkin’s body man, and he seemed to be angry about it. Scowling at anything and everything, he did not say a word during the meeting. The other man was a Black American archaeologist who seemed only too pleased to have this kind of opportunity. Larkin told us of fabulous riches which could be recovered at this ruined temple. According to him, he would have done it already if he had had a proper team with him. He said it would take about a week all told to travel there, first by truck to Puno, then by mule to the ruin itself. When asked some questions about the site, Larkin showed the group two archaeological pieces found previously at the site, both made from gold. The first was a sort of pendant depicting a man-shaped figure holding two rods. The second, a golden cup, had turqoise inlay in strange non-repeating shapes. After satisfying our curiousity regarding his previous attempts Larkin and Mendoza bade us good night with plans to prepare to leave for the journey in two days time. Hughes and the rest of us stayed for another drink.

What’s Really Going On? No sooner had Larkin and de Mendoza left than Hughes told us that he wasn’t an archaeologist and his name wasn’t Hughes, but that in fact he was an investigative reporter named Jackson Elias. Thinking back on it, several members of our group had actually read some Elias' work, which was predominantly focused on investigating occult death cults. He went on to tell us that he was investigating Larkin and his strange story regarding the pyramid. He pointed out that the two items Larkin had produced couldn’t possibly be from the same site, as one (the cup) was Incan and from the 15th century, while the pendant was from around the 5th century. Elias told us that he’d been looking into Larkin for a while at this point, and that he’d found traces of a centuries-old death cult near Lake Titicaca (which is quite near Puno and the site of the ruins). Apparently, on his previous expedition Larkin had attempted to hire locals from Puno to venture into the temple, however they refused because of stories of a local creature called a kharisiri, which evidently is some kind of fat-sucking devil. Discussing the ramifications of all this, we decided that we couldn’t possibly take Larkin at his word at this point. We decided that it would be best to perform some of our own research by heading to the archaeological museum in the morning. We made plans to meet Elias there and went to bed.

A Trip to the Museum Fortunately for us, just down the road a ways from our hotel was the Museo de Arqueologia y Antropologia, so following breakfast we reconvened there at the office of Prof. Sanchez, a friend and contact of Elias. Sanchez told us a curious story: evidently he had, upon reading the story of Larkin’s planned expedition, reached out to try and lend his expertise to the project. Rather than hire on one of the leading experts (someone I would surely like to have along, were I planning an archaeological excavation) Larkin had rebuffed Sanchez’s efforts regarding the pyramid. We spent some time discussing the ruins and querying Sanchez about them, and he told us about recovering a journal written by a conquistador which speaks of something very similar and may reveal its location. Sanchez’s assistant, Trinidad Rizo, had just went down to the storeroom to locate the journal, but had been gone for some time, so Arthur and I decided to go check on her. Downstairs, we found the door to the storeroom ajar, and upon investigating we discovered the emaciated body of a young woman, missing a palm-sized disk of flesh from her abdomen. She had fallen in the storeroom and been covered by a moderate amount of clutter, and in her fall had broken open a wooden crate packed with straw. We couldn’t help but notice (as we moved Rizo’s body while investigating) the large piece of worked gold inlaid with geometric patterns that was poking out of the box, so naturally we collected it. Looking around, Arthur located a trail of bloody footprints and we followed them out to the street, where suddenly we heard a loud bang and the screams of passersby trying to get away from a vehicle which had suddenly caught fire. Continuing onward we followed the trail out the back exit to the street, and then around the building to the window from Sanchez’s office where it ended. Not knowing anywhere else to go, we went back inside to discuss events with our companions. We showed them the 2ft rod of gold, and then began deciphering Rizo’s notebook. The notebook told the harrowing tale of a conquistador named Gaspar de Figueroa, who had come to Peru in the company of Pizarro and also joined by four others: Hernando Ruiz, Diego Garrida, Luis de Mendoza, and Pedro de Velasco. Everyone in the room sat up with a strange look when we read the third name - surely this could not be the same man we had met the night before?

The Obligatory Trip to the Library Not able to determine anything further at the museum but simultaneously feeling that we did not know enough yet, we decided to go to the local library to see what we could turn up. While I searched in vain for a text about the history of the local area, the others in the group found a document tying Figueroa to a Padre de los Gusanos, and Sanchez managed to piece together the location to the pyramid, south of Puno. We decided as a group to prepare as rapidly as we could and depart Lima ahead of Larkin. If we could get to the ruins ahead of him, we could perhaps head off whatever strange plot he had concocted. That settled, we divided up tasks and set about gathering supplies for the journey.

Turns out he talks after all Towards the end of the day we met up once again for dinner. On the way back to the hotel, I noticed that we were being followed in the street.

Confronting him, he made vaguely threatening statements to us, in particular saying that he “always looks in on anyone working with the master”, whatever that means.

Final Thoughts This session comprised roughly half of the prologue chapter of the campaign.

While we haven’t really done much yet I can say with some certainty that this is a very cool game, and I’m really excited to have a chance to play Masks.

Before we go any further, I should mention that I learned about this technique from Matt Colville’s Running the Game videos: Let’s put this technique into practice and build some better derro!

A character’s attack roll boils down to: 1d20 + Proficiency bonus + attribute modifier + magic bonus + situational bonus This is essentially what it’s been since 3rd edition came out (though we called it Base Attack Bonus back then). The big change has been the rate at which these different numbers change. The attribute modifier is mostly about the same, however in 5e there is a hard maximum that did not exist in 3.x, meaning that a similar 3.x character might have another point or two from attribute modifiers. Similarly, magic item bonuses from weapons are roughly similar, though the 3.x values tended to be a bit higher. Where you see the big difference is in proficiency bonuses and magic/situational bonuses. A 5th edition PC’s proficiency bonus starts at +2 and goes to +6, while a 3rd edition PC’s base attack bonus ranges from +0 all the way to +20 (depending on class selection). A 3rd edition PC generally has access to far more magic items that affect attacks than a 5th edition PC. This is for a couple of reasons: 5th edition has attunement requirements for many items (particularly ones which impact attack rolls), 5e’s treasure tables give out way fewer items overall, and it regularly gives advantage or disadvantage rather than a strict modifier to the roll. A 3rd edition PC has many ways to stack up situational bonuses that are typically not available to a 5e PC. These are things like flanking (which gave +2 to attack instead of advantage), charging, feats, spell effects, and so on. Many things that gave small modifiers in 3.x give advantage in 5e. The net effect here is that in 3rd edition, the range of values from an attack roll was quite large, while in 5th edition it doesn’t change too much. In 3rd edition, a low-level challenge such as a goblin or kobold was simply not a threat at high levels, as you only missed if you rolled a 1 and it only hit you if it rolled a 20. The same situation is much more threatening and challenging in 5th edition: if your AC has only increased by +3, then the goblin is only 15% less likely to hit you. If your attack bonus has increased +5 (which is a really huge amount in 5e) you are still only 25% more likely to hit a goblin. The impact on the game? Goblins (and kobolds, and orcs, and so on) are still meaningful threats at higher-level play, when in 3rd edition they weren’t even speed bumps. This is pretty cool!

Especially if we take a look at what monsters in 4th edition looked like, it seems like enemies not only have a lot less variety, but also that they are generally less interesting. I think this may be a result of trying to keep enemies relevant across many levels? Anyways, let’s take a look at derro in 5e: AC 13 3 HD Advantage on saves against spells Melee: hooked spear, +2 to hit, 1d6 damage, can knock the target prone Ranged: light crossbow, +4 to hit, 1d8+2 damage Let’s look at what Keith Ammann has to say about Derro over at The Monsters Know: With high Dexterity and above-average Constitution but merely average Strength, derro are skirmishers, but not especially mobile ones. Their Intelligence is average, but their Wisdom, for some reason, is in the cellar. This is unusual; the reverse is far more common, especially since Wisdom supports the Perception skill. Not only are they easy to get the drop on, they also have an underdeveloped survival instinct, making them more likely to fight to the death. They are, however, proficient in Stealth, predisposing them toward an ambush strategy. Look, this is a boring enemy. And while that’s fine, not every enemy is going to be all that interesting, this is still the foot soldier for this faction. Speaking of factions, the other kind of derro is a savant, who is a 5th level spellcaster with 8HD and AC 13. One challenging thing here is that derro have CR 1/4 and the derro savant has lightning bolt so it can be challenging to thread the needle of appropriate danger for your party (if you are worried about that sort of thing). The bigger issue is that there’s not a lot going on here. There are two kinds of derro, the kind that are easy to surprise and weak and the kind that cast lightning bolt and are weak. So tactically speaking they’re somewhat boring. But the bigger issue here is that they are essentially a monoculture, they’re cookie-cutter by nature. I’d like to have my PC’s face enemies that impart a sense of believability. Intelligent creatures (like derro, goblins, or any other kind of traditional enemy like that) are not going to conform to descriptions like this. There has to be more going on, doesn’t there?

So what do I think we should do instead? Is there a better way to handle intelligent enemies? Isn’t this how we’ve been playing D\u0026D for 50 years? Well, yes and no. It is mostly how we’ve been playing, certainly since the late 80s when I first played. But there was a period of time when enemy design was quite a bit more interesting. Take a look at the derro from 4th edition Monster Manual 3: Role Attacks Special Artillery Hand crossbow, dagger Bolt spray close AoE, +2d6 damage w/advantage Minion Club Suicide to turn miss into a hit Skirmisher Battleaxe -2 attack/+2d6 damage when bloodied, free attack if opponent bloodied Lurker War pick move and hide as an action, knock target unconscious if hidden as an action, shackle a target as an action, +2d6 damage w/advantage Soldier Spear, punch knock target prone as minor action Controller Scourge, psychic scourge (ranged) creates a lasting AoE centered on an ally, push all creatures within AoE as minor action Brute bite, tentacle flailing tentacle (AoE, must be bloodied), constant AoE damage If you’re unfamiliar with how 4th edition worked, this probably looks strange. The basic idea is that characters (player and otherwise) filled certain reasonably-well-defined combat roles that informed the sorts of things they did. The derro in 4th edition are much higher level but we can see from this list that they all do something interesting, they have attacks that are mostly different from each other, and when they bring special abilities into play they create really interesting enemy variety. What I find really appealing about this method of enemy design is that you really don’t need any more details to get a pretty decent understanding of how a fight with these folks is going to go down: The brute is going to wade into the thickest clump of enemies and try and get everyone in range of its AoE tentacle attacks The soldiers will try to create a sort of front line and knock enemies prone to grant advantage to their allies The artillery (personally I would’ve chosen archer as the name) has a hand crossbow so they’ll try to maneuver into a position to hit as many enemies as possible with their bolt spray attack. The lurkers do a crapload of damage if they’re able to get advantage, and they have the ability to eliminate individual targets, so they’ll sneak around and attack the lfnaks The controller will put their zone ability on the most convenient ally and then move enemies around to create advantages for their side So if we imagine our PC’s fighting against a lot of derro (they’re clearing out a fort, for instance) they’ll experience a lot of different encounters. Of course you’re not going to get a huge mix of all of these different enemy types in every group, most will be soldiers and artillery probably, but even just that small change makes a huge difference.

We’ll stick to just tweaking stats and modifying equipment because we don’t want to change their CR. And we’ll leave the savant alone for now. Let’s take the regular derro and create a soldier version. The original version is already a pretty decent archer so we’ll have it lose the spear and use a dagger instead. On top of that we’ll tweak its stats a little bit by reducing its constitution and bumping its dexterity. For the soldier, we’ll tweak the stats a bit. They’ve got a bit more strength and a bit less dexterity and intelligence (smart and nimble derro don’t get into melee combat, after all). They’ve got chain shirts instead of leather armor and javelins instead of a crossbow. Trait Archer Soldier Strength: 10 13 Dexterity: 14 12 Intelligence: 11 8 Constitution: 10 12 AC: 13 14 Attacks: Dagger +2/1d6, crossbow +4/1d8+2 Hooked spear +3/1d6+1 This is a pretty small set of changes, but the result is a clear differentiation between different groups of enemies. When your PC’s see these derro, you can describe the archers as small, nimble-looking crossbow wielders wearing leather armor, who scamper around and keep their distance. The soldiers, in comparison, look like absolute hulks, wearing chain shirts and wielding spears. In combat we haven’t really changed their overall capabilities very much (since we haven’t added any new attacks or actions), we’ve just divided the group up. Now your players can look at their enemies and intuit their behavior based on their appearance and their equipment. This makes the encounter more interesting, and it makes it more rewarding when the players win.

If we really want to instill character into our enemies we can go much further, by adding new actions and capabilities. This is difficult at low level because your PC’s aren’t very powerful, but as they gain levels you can do things like give certain enemy types damage resistances that others don’t have, feats, significantly better equipment variation, and so on. I also suggest mining the 4th edition books for other implementations of roles. We’ll do some more of this in later posts and make some higher level enemies.

There should be lots of different human languages in your setting. A singular “common tongue” is total bullshit, meant to smooth over difficult worldbuilding and actually challenging social encounters. There are about 8 billion people on the earth, and there are about 6,500 languages spoken, some of which by very few people. Even if with 100 times fewer, with a mere 65 languages, that’s still about 64 more languages than are commonly spoken by humans in your average D\u0026D game.

Point is, there are lots of lots of languages, and all of them are normal to somebody. That’s not what this post is about.

I’ll have more to say about both cultures and geography in the future, for now check the footnotes: Language Cultural / Geographic Usage Description Eryssian Dominant language of Eryssia1, used in forest, plains, and diverse cultures. The closest thing the setting has to common at this stage. Like English, it is formed by smashing together a number of other languages. Glaeyn Dominant language in Glaeyd Strium2, used in forest and diverse cultures. A lilting and musical language much like elvish. Mashid Primary/aristocratic language in the Mashioque Dynasty3. An ancient language that hasn’t changed much in centuries. Anywhere outside the Dynasty, it’s considered needlessly formal and is only spoken by academics or privately tutored students, that sort of thing. Rhurin Commoner language in the Mashioque Dynasty. This language descended from the non-Dragonborn inhabitants of the mountains in easter Yeileth, so it is identified with dwarves, goblins, and other miner types. Sounds a lot like Klingon. Eopian Spoken in the plains in eastern Yeileth4. The people who live in the grasslands and foothills of eastern Yeileth are considered more cosmopolitan, engaging in frequent trade with the Free Cities and the Dynasty. More recently, the Dynasty has claimed some of this territory, resulting in this language becoming associated with the Mashioque Army. Ghikrali Spoken in the plains in southwestern Yeileth. The plains south of Glaed Strium are a vast sea of grasslands with very little to break it up. Not very many people leave here. Niovarin Used broadly by the underground cultures of Yeileth, in both Glaeyd Strium and the Mashioque Dynasty. We haven’t explored the underdark much, but if there were an undercommon, this would be it. Azish Used in the mountains in central Eryssia. Viewed as a sort of hillbilly tongue in Alcona5, it is either a point of pride (among the goliaths and orcs who speak it) or derision (from the elves in the capital). Ionqali Used by nearly all seagoing people in the Western Bay. This is something akin a trade tongue, used by Free Cities traders, tritons, and humans from Corus alike.

A big part of this is the relationship between mortals and the gods. In settings such as the Forgotten Realms or Greyhawk, divine magic comes from the gods themselves. That isn’t the case in Sinath Lonn. There are basically two types of gods in this world. The first are patron gods, and they are typically concerned with an individual race such as elves or orcs. The second are greater gods, who get involved in things that they care about in somewhat fickle and inconsistent ways. Note I’ve obviously lifted all of these straight out of existing settings. So far in the campaign the gods' involvement has been pretty low, so there’s still plenty of time to rectify this. I’m planning on going through and recreating the pantheon using some generator tools, such as those provided Kevin Crawford at Sine Nomine.

The second element is the actual text of the post, which is written in Markdown and should be relatively straightforward. The more interesting part is the first element, the front matter, which Hugo generates in .yaml format by default: ---title:\"First Post\"date:2021-10-06T17:04:45-07:00draft:true--- We see that Hugo has filled in the title and date for us and then set draft: true. Additional front matter elements we might want to use include: description: a description of the post. keywords: a list of keywords in the post. tags: a list of tags for the post. Hugo automatically generates meta pages for tags and categories, which we’ll see later. slug: allows you to override the URL, if this is not set then the filename is used. categories: like tags, allows you to have Hugo organize the post in a generated meta list. There are a lot of capabilities I have skipped over here, read the docs for the full list.

They are a cleric of law and order, and are seeking their life’s purpose. Zo-zu, a human/goblin artificer from the Empire of Corus.

Ashal, a leonin fighter from the plains of the Mashioque Dynasty, died when overrun by angry blights animated to defend the Ellisdeen Wilds. The party has been on a quest to retrieve a mysterious artifact, the Heart of the Forest, and return it to its rightful place in the far northeast part of the Ellisdeen Wilds. In our most recent session they have found the temple to return the heart, only to discover it is some kind of ancient technology. They attempted to replace the heart in its sarcophagus but failed to realize that the apparatus had been damaged when it was stolen. This caused the replacement to go awry and the installation defenses triggered. One of the bugbear allies stayed behind to buy the party time to escape, and we have not yet seen the fallout of this.

My pronouns are he/him/his. I consider myself on the far left side of the political spectrum. I plan to use this site to chat about my hobbies: I’ve been playing and running various RPG’s since the 90s. Mostly this has been D\u0026D/Pathfinder, but I have also enjoyed (in no particular order) Traveller, World of Darkness, Brave New World, GURPS, and a litany of other games. More recently I’ve been digging into the OSR and am starting an Old School Essentials game. I play video games also. My steam library is extensive. I tend to refrain from competitive multiplayer games and usually enjoy CRPG’s, strategy, and narrative-first games, although a decade or so ago I played a lot of Battlefield. I watch a fair amount of TV and movies and might talk about them. I like tech and enjoy setting up a relatively sophisticated home network.
