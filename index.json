Of the six attack rolls she has made, 4 have been critical hits. She steals everything that isn’t nailed down. Sanghorn, an aasimar monk. He’s thought he was human his whole life, but recently started hearing from a spirit in his head, and has come to Waterdeep to find out what this means. Tirsa, a satyr bard. We don’t know a ton about her yet, but she loves to play tricks on people and use her wiles to have her way. Sgawl, a gnome sorcerer. They’re very quiet but are able to unleash a significant amount of arcane power. They’re somewhat grown over with moss, like Radagast. The party is midway through chapter one.

In the Radiant Gaia setting, half-orcs are raised on stories of the heroism and valor of their orc ancestors, and Beatrix aspires to this. She believes strongly in the value of law and order, and had a promising career in the city watch before she had to give it up in order to pay off a gambling debt her lousy brother had built up. She is a competent warrior who focuses on utilizing her strong defense to protect other members of the party, keeping the enemy off balance and focused on her.

The current party: Brisby, a halfling/goblin cleric from the mountains of the Mashioque Dynasty. They were raised by their adopted Dragonborn family and are not aware of their goblin heritage. They are a cleric of law and order, and are seeking their life’s purpose. Zo-zu, a human/goblin artificer from the Empire of Corus. A member of the Corus army, he’s been deployed as part of the peacekeeping forces to the area and serves as the connection to the party’s primary patron. Greta, a dwarf investigator from the Free Cities of Mihira. A middle-aged woman with a family back home, she is wandering the world in search of her long-lost brother. Magdrek, a bugbear barbarian from the Ellisdeen Wilds in western Eryssia. A follower of Hruggek, the patron of violence, he believes in might being right and the value of proving your point physically. Previous party members: Lein, a tortle monk from Glaeyd Strium, died from a derro hook spear to the head while pacifying a temple to Bha’al. Ashal, a leonin fighter from the plains of the Mashioque Dynasty, died when overrun by angry blights animated to defend the Ellisdeen Wilds. The party has been on a quest to retrieve a mysterious artifact, the Heart of the Forest, and return it to its rightful place in the far northeast part of the Ellisdeen Wilds. In our most recent session they have found the temple to return the heart, only to discover it is some kind of ancient technology. They attempted to replace the heart in its sarcophagus but failed to realize that the apparatus had been damaged when it was stolen. This caused the replacement to go awry and the installation defenses triggered. One of the bugbear allies stayed behind to buy the party time to escape, and we have not yet seen the fallout of this.

I’m starting this blog to share some thoughts on my interests. This will probably be limited mostly to gaming and tech since those are the things I generally feel the safest sharing with others, but who knows? A bit about me: I’m a cis white 18-49 American. My pronouns are he/him/his. I consider myself on the far left side of the political spectrum. I plan to use this site to chat about my hobbies: I’ve been playing and running various RPG’s since the 90s. Mostly this has been D\u0026D/Pathfinder, but I have also enjoyed (in no particular order) Traveller, World of Darkness, Brave New World, GURPS, and a litany of other games. More recently I’ve been digging into the OSR and am starting an Old School Essentials game. I play video games also. My steam library is extensive. I tend to refrain from competitive multiplayer games and usually enjoy CRPG’s, strategy, and narrative-first games, although a decade or so ago I played a lot of Battlefield. I watch a fair amount of TV and movies and might talk about them. I like tech and enjoy setting up a relatively sophisticated home network. I try to self-host anything I can and intend to share some of what I’ve learned. Things you won’t find here: Support for cops, Nazis, or gender roles.
