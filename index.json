The Prologue Continues Lima, Peru - March 20, 1921 The sinister encounter with Luis de Mendoza the previous evening motivated us to do all we could to prepare for the upcoming journey. We met with Prof. Sanchez to coordinate our efforts, and he revealed that he would not be able to secure the trucks needed for the 4-day trip to Puno without a significant amount of funds up front. Arthur thought better of it and went with him to negotiate the amount down to $500. While he and Sanchez secured transportation, the rest of us gathered our supplies for the journey. Considering again the journal collected from Sanchez’s office, Elias said he had come to determine that the story regarding the cult of the kharisiri had started appearing after the original looting of the temple by the conquistadors1 in the 15th century. We weren’t sure exactly what to make of this, as how could it possibly be related to anything going on in the 20th century?

Journey to the Andes The road from Lima to Puno Puno, Peru - March 24, 1921 The trek south took four days but was unremarkable. We arrived in quite a small town, fit only to secure animals for the trek up to the ruins. We looked around town for a newspaper, library, or somewhere else we could find out any further location about the area, but nothing was available. Not wanting to waste any further time, we loaded up on our mounts for the 3-day journy to the ruins. The first night of the trek saw the weather turn foul. The temperature dropped significantly and we were glad we had packed our warm clothing. The winds picked so it was all we could do to keep our tents on the ground. Nobody noticed when one of the pack mules was attacked and killed sometime during the night. Just like at the museum, a disk of skin had been removed and all the fat had been sucked out of the resulting hole. Perry and I examined the ground to try and determine what had done this, and he located human footprints that led past several of our tents before arriving where the mule had been hobbled. Not wanting to risk running out of supplies, we took a few hours and redistributed the load among the remaining animals before resuming the journey. Towards the afternoon of the second day, as we were approaching a hilltop, several of us heard gunshots in the distance ahead of us. Several of us dismounted our horses and took our rifles to the top of the hill to investigate. We shaded our eyes and peered around, finally picking out a pair of figures in the distance. Cursing at ourselves for not thinking to bring binoculars, we were able to make out that one of the figures was prone, and the other standing over him in a defensive posture with a rifle. He seemed to be looking away from us in the direction of the ruins. Concerned that this may have been an encounter with the kharasiri we hastened to remount and see if we could render aid. When we drew close to the pair, the man whirled and aimed his rifle at us, shouting in Spanish, calling us ‘white devils’ and bandits. Despite my years of expertise, the excitement and stress of having a gun pointed at me again (for it had been some years since the War ended) caused me to lose all facility with the language. Luckily, Sanchez stepped in and convinced the man that we were merely travelers who had just come upon the scene, and that we had nothing to do with those who had attacked them. Arthur and Eleanor dismounted and rendered aid to the boy while Sanchez, Perry, and myself spoke with the man. He told us his name was Julio, and that he and his son Domingo had been attacked by two people, a white man in tattered rags and an Uru2 woman wearing local dress. Both looked like they had been living outdoors for quite a while. They attacked but Julio was able to fight them off, at which point they fled south towards the ruins. Once Domingo had been stabilized, we propped him up on one of the horses and accompanied Julio back to their farm. The farm turned out to be more of a shack, where these two lived by themselves and raised their sheep. Julio graciously prepared a dinner and we spoke at length about the surrounding area and its history. According to Julio, very few people lived in this area close to the ruins because of the stories of the\u001a kharasiri. We asked him about the kharasiri attacks and he said that they had only really started relatively recently, within the past several months. This caught our attention and we asked if this had anything to do with Larkin’s previous expedition. Julio hadn’t met Larkin, but he had seen the man come south to the ruins several months back, accompanied by a man we quickly recognized as de Mendoza. Larkin had attempted to hire some of the people in the area but all had refused. Concerned about the possibility of another attack, we took turns keeping watch, though thankfully nothing happened.

The Hidden Valley Peruvian Highlands - March 27, 1921 By evening, the kharasiri had led us to a valley with a plateau in its center. Atop the plateau was the remains of an ancient structure, about 50 yards across, with the top of a pyramid extending out of the earth on its northwest side. We were quickly faced with a difficult decision between two routes to the temple. On the one hand we could take the road which wound through several switchbacks down to the temple. If we were willing to leave our mounts behind, however, we could try to climb down the valley wall and arrive much sooner. Not willing to risk abandoning the mounts, we opted to play it safe and take the road. Much to our chagrin, as we were doing so, we saw the two kharasiri had taken the fast route and outpaced us to the temple. We stood and watched as the pair passed through a gate on the east side of the outer wall and walk up the steps to the top of the pyramid. One after the other, each kharasiri stepped over to a large crack in the roof of the pyramid, then proceeded to crouch and bend down so to bring their face near the opening. What happened next was difficult to believe, yet I swear it to be what we saw! The kharasiri, huddled now over the crack in the roof of the pyramid, unhinged their jaw and disgorged a thick stream of some sort of white fluid from their mouth directly into the opening below. This took several minutes each, and for the entire time our group stood on and watched in stunned silence. Once they had finished their foul obeisances, the kharasiri stood and descended down the far side of the pyramid and out of view. We stood for a few moments looking at each other, but nobody seemed willing to put voice to the question of whether we wanted to turn back. As a group we pressed onwards, reaching the plateau and the crumbling outer wall surrounding the ruins. Looking in past the wall, we could see the remains of interior walls to the south of the pyramid, showing the skeleton of other structures which had worn away. We hobbled the mounts in the northeastern corner of the courtyard, where there was an open section of ground near the wall. With only an hour or so of daylight remaining, we split up to search the grounds.

The Ruined Temple The temple grounds The pyramid dominated the northwest portion of the ruins, and was partially covered with earth, with only the top 5 stone steps exposed above ground. The skeletal remains of the ruined structures filled the space to the south of the pyramid, while to its east was a scattering of rubble and some sort of structure about waist-high. To our south was some sort of large pit or shaft. We split up in several groups to try and examine these different areas and determine where the kharasiri had disappeared to. Perry moved to the south side of the pyramid in order to try to pick up any tracks that they may have left behind, and those who went with him noticed immediately that a horrific smell was emanating from the top of the pyramid, as of some sort of corruption or filth, as well as a loud buzzing sound like flies. Though he was unable to locate any tracks in the dry ground, it was feasible that the kharasiri had moved south through the ruined walls, so he and the others moved that way. Approaching the walls, we saw that they were in fact decorated with block-like figures that were similar (but not an exact match) to the style we saw on the pendant which Larkin showed us at our first meeting. Whether this indicated that Larkin had actually recovered the piece here, we couldn’t say, but it was interesting nonetheless. There were no signs that the kharasiri had actually gone this way, but they certainly could have, so we continued onwards to the strange pit we had seen earlier. What we saw there reminded me all too strongly of what I saw at the Somme. The southeast corner of the ruined courtyard was occupied by an square pit, fifteen feet on a side. As we approached we could smell the foul stench of rot and corruption, and my fear was confirmed when we closed enough to see that it was an open grave, filled with rotting human corpses reaching about ten feet below the ground. Looking at my companions one could immediately distinguish those who had fought in the War - the only difference between my experiences at the Somme4 and what we saw before us was that the earth here was dry, and that instead of uniforms the people had been wearing the typical clothes of a farmer or shepherd in the area. Even still, we each of us covered our faces with handkerchiefs and the like, and retreated as soon as we were able. Rejoining the others, we decided to further explore the opening in the northeast section. Perry, ever the adventurous sort, shone his torch below and revealed a drop of some fifteen feet to a floor of packed earth. Not seeing any other means of descent, and with no other ideas to explore, we broke out rope, tools, lights, and our weapons, and made ready for the group to descend into the shaft. Perry led the way with one of those great American pistols and a torch, descending on a rope we secured above.

The Depths of the Earth As I looked at this dark hole in the ground, I could not help but think about the two kharasiri we had spotted earlier, and how we had still not found them. Dr. Dibden had been muttering to himself all day about them, saying that he could not figure out how they fed because the wounds they left behind looked nothing like human bite marks. All I could picture was running into one of them in a dark tunnel! And yet, brave as he is, Perry climbed down the rope with gun in hand as if it were just a walk to the cafe. Pausing at the bottom of the rope, he surveyed his surroundings. He stood in a T intersection, where one tunnel started and led to the south, with two other tunnels leading east and west. Shining his torch down each of the tunnels in turn, he was able to make out some sort of objects in a room to the east, and to the west was a bundle of rags and sticks in the middle of the dirt floor. The tunnel south led off into darkness, so Perry decided to check the vicinity to make sure it was safe before calling us down after him. Investigating the path to the west, Perry moved closer to the pile of rags and shone his light on it and discovered that it was actually a mummified corpse, swathed in wool and cotton. It was clear the corpse had been laying there for quite a long time indeed. To his great astonishment, as Perry stepped closer the body started to move! Its limbs flexed and stretched, dragging itself along the ground slowly towards him. Perry stood for a moment transfixed in horror, but (thinking much more quickly than I ever could) he swiftly pulled out a cigarette lighter, flicked it, and tossed it into the moldering pile of rags wrapping the body. The rags caught fire immediately, and luckily it rapidly spread so that in a matter of seconds the creature was being consumed in flame. Perry stood back and watched the thing burn for a few moments as it slowed and eventually stopped entirely before the flames went out. The horror continued as a small white larva of some kind crawled out of the thing’s ear and began slithering away. Perry rapidly stomped on the sluglike creature and it burst, giving off the distinctive corruption smell we had detected earlier near the pyramid. Giving a quick glance down the other two tunnels, Perry did not see anything to the south, and to the east the tunnel ended quite nearby in a small chamber filled with glittering objects. Not seeing any other items of immediate importance, Perry called for the rest of us to climb down the rope and join him. This took rather a long time as there were 6 of us, and some of us were not so accustomed to this sort of exertion. However, after a short while we had convened as a group, crowding in the dark tunnel around the intersection. We oriented to the east, weapons at the ready, and proceeded into the small chamber.

Around the edges of the room were, for lack of better words to describe it, piles of gold. There were a great many golden artifacts and objects piled loosely against the walls, stretching from the pre-Incan all the way to modern. In the center of the room were three filthy sleeping mats woven from reeds of some kind. Astonishingly, two of these mats were occupied by the kharasiri we had, seen earlier, who were somehow sleeping. We were in luck, and had managed to stay quiet enough not to wake them! I had my Mauser at the ready, and backed away to keep them covered while Dr. Dibden moved in for a closer look. From the corner of my eye, I could see Jennifer and Perry take up similar ready positions, while Eleanor, Elias, and Prof. Sanchez kept out of the way down the tunnel. Dr. Dibden squatted down and began examining the male kharasiri in an attempt to determine just what made them different. He pulled a few of the man’s rags aside but wasn’t able to find anything. He finally pulled the man’s shirt up to uncover his stomach, but this woke the monster up. He jerked awake and tried to grab the doctor and I am ashamed to say I was so nervous I pulled the trigger without thinking. Mercifully, I was on target and hit the kharasiri, not the doctor, but still there is no excuse! As soon as the first shot went off, the room descended into chaos. Two more shots went off in quick succession, and the first kharasiri was dead, but in the time it took the second had leapt to her feet and pounced on Eleanor. I didn’t see what happened in the confusion, but the monster did something to her chest and the next I saw she was clutching her stomach as her blouse suddenly soaked through with blood. I don’t even know what happened next except that the three of us with guns all seemed to shoot into the melee with reckless disregard for our safety, all of us thinking only of trying to save Eleanor from the fate of Sanchez’s assistant, Rizo. It seemed that I blinked my eyes and when I looked up again, both kharasiri were down and unmoving, and Eleanor had fallen to the floor, leaning against one of the walls. Hardly knowing how to react at this point, Perry and I moved to try and help Eleanor with her wound, while incongruously Dr. Dibden started inspecting the dead kharasiri. Perhaps he did not realize what had happened? Perry barked at him to come help our wounded friend, and he seemed to come back to reality and hurried over to bandage her.5 We checked each other over to make sure everyone else was all right, then I went to keep watch in the tunnel while the others searched the room. Thinking on what we found, the kharasiri must have been feeding on victims and collecting their belongings there in that chamber for generations. No other explanation makes sense. There were hundreds of different objects, mostly made of gold, silver, or other valuables, and almost all were the sorts of thing someone might carry in their pocket. There were fine watches, good pens, money clips, a great many earrings, rings, and bracelets, spurs, monocles, canes, knives, and more than we could really count. What’s more, none of the material seemed to belong here in the ruin, but was (so far as we could tell) the ill-begotten gains of devouring passersby on the road for more years than we could count. We determined to work out how to recover this treasure before we left so we could bring it with us on our return to Lima. Steeling ourselves to what lay ahead, we took the tunnel south. Our suspicions were confirmed, as the passageway ended in a chest-high hole, plugged with rotting corpses. There clearly was some form of hidden tunnel entrance in the mass grave we had seen earlier, and this must have been how the kharisiri had entered their lair. We didn’t waste any more time here but moved to explore the western passage.

Behind was packed earth, while ahead and to our left was stone - we had found the base of the pyramid. We took the left-hand fork and traced it around, examining the intricate inlays on its surface. There were nonrepeating geometric shapes, just like the worked gold carving we had found in the storeroom at the museum. On the south side of the pyramid we found something quite out of place. The strip of inlaid carving which we had been following was missing a section, which seemed to us must have been the piece we’d brought with us. We wouldn’t be able to find out immediately, however, as the missing section was right over a two-inch crack in the wall and floor of the pyramid. Rancid white fat slowly dripped out of the crack in the wall and fell to the floor, forming a knee-deep pool covering the passage and stretching out for several yards in each direction. We paused to consider the quandary and discuss our options. When it was proposed that someone could simply wade through the puddle to inspect the crack, I pointed out that the kharasiri may have been infected with something from within, and that we should avoid touching it at all costs. The gold inlay piece was fetched from above and the rest of the pyramid structure was inspected, but this was the only point where we were able to do anything. All we could think to do was replace the inlay piece on the pyramid wall and hope that this would somehow seal it up again. We stood around scratching our heads for a while, and then I proposed that we form a sort of makeshift platform using the rest of our rope and the woven sleeping mats. By tying them together into a sort of hammock at the center of several lengths of rope, we could suspend someone over the middle of the pool by stretching the rope ends taut from both sides. If the person were light enough and the ropes taught enough, they would be able to replace the inlay piece without being exposed to the pool. Nobody else had any ideas, so we set about to work. It turns out I am the smallest among the men in our group so naturally I volunteered to be suspended over the pool. I tied my kerchief around my face and got to it. Sitting as still as I could, the others lifted me up and carried me over to the center of the pool. Keeping well back from the crack, I held the inlay piece up and pressed it firmly into place. The reaction was almost immediate, the steady stream of rancid fluid slowed to a trickle over a period of ten seconds or so, like someone shutting off a tap very slowly, before finally coming to a stop. We couldn’t see what else to do, so we recovered ourselves and retreated to the main intersection. The day had fully escaped us at this point, so we set about recovering the treasure and preparing our camp. Dr. Dibden graciously took first watch while the rest of us got some much-needed rest.

Revelations Later in the evening, while Arthur was still on watch, he heard the sound of footsteps coming up the dusty trail from the east. He quickly woke the rest of us, and we were rolling out of our tents when Augustus Larkin stumbled through the gate to our south, holding a withered and sickly Luis de Mendoza up by the arm and practically dragging him along. When they got to the center of the courtyard, Larkin paused and lowered Mendoza to the earth. No sooner was he down than Mendoza let out a bellowing scream and then practically withered away before our eyes. It was almost as if he were a figure from a pulp novel, as he faded away into a pile of dust. We confronted Larkin, who seemed shocked to see us and asked why we had abandoned him in Lima. Ignoring his questions, we asked what he was doing here, and he tried to bluff his way into our good graces. Being none too polite about it, we told him that the pyramid was not the only thing that stunk, and he had better try harder than that if he wanted to convince us. At this, he underwent some sort of transformation. What had been a weak, almost pleading sort of man disappeared, transforming himself by manner and voice into a powerful and threatening figure. He conceded that we had got the better of him this time but taunted us that there were many more where this one came from, and that he would be seeing us again soon. And then he reached his hands up to the sides of his head and broke his own neck before our very eyes. We had a sort of collective gasp of astonishment at this, but the night grew still and nothing else seemed to be happening, so we moved to examine him for any further information. We found that he had very little in his posession, just a small vial of morphine and the clothes on his back. But when the doctor examined him, he found a curious tattoo on Larkin’s chest.

Conclusion There is not much to say about the rest of our expedition. Eleanor was quite heavily wounded so we took our time returning, first to Puno and then to Lima. We recovered quite a lot of treasure, enough to amount to about $5,000 apiece. Mr. Elias gathered quite a bit of detail for his book, and Prof. Sanchez the opportunity of a lifetime which I suspect he might regret having taken. After resolving our affairs in Lima, we each went our separate ways. I decided that I had had enough of academia for the moment, and wrote the Dean at Berkeley to let him know that I would be taking an extended sabbatical. I decided that I could do with some more time out in the world, and spent some time travelling about Central America before deciding what my next course would be.

Rendezvous in Lima Each of the investigators had independently learned of a rich American explorer assembling an expedition to explore an ancient pyramid in southern Peru, and (mostly for curiousity) we had each decided to sign on. We met Mr. Larkin at the Bar Cardenas in Lima, Peru in the evening of March 18th, 1921 to discuss the expedition and make plans for the journey. Wearing a fine linen suit and bearing an upbeat, confident manner, Larkin told us a tall tale of an ancient pyramid structure in the Peruvian highlands to the southeast. Accompanying Larkin were two other men who had signed on to the journey. Luis de Mendoza was clearly Larkin’s body man, and he seemed to be angry about it. Scowling at anything and everything, he did not say a word during the meeting. The other man was a Black American archaeologist who seemed only too pleased to have this kind of opportunity. Larkin told us of fabulous riches which could be recovered at this ruined temple. According to him, he would have done it already if he had had a proper team with him. He said it would take about a week all told to travel there, first by truck to Puno, then by mule to the ruin itself. When asked some questions about the site, Larkin showed the group two archaeological pieces found previously at the site, both made from gold. The first was a sort of pendant depicting a man-shaped figure holding two rods. The second, a golden cup, had turqoise inlay in strange non-repeating shapes. After satisfying our curiousity regarding his previous attempts Larkin and Mendoza bade us good night with plans to prepare to leave for the journey in two days time. Hughes and the rest of us stayed for another drink.

What’s Really Going On? No sooner had Larkin and de Mendoza left than Hughes told us that he wasn’t an archaeologist and his name wasn’t Hughes, but that in fact he was an investigative reporter named Jackson Elias. Thinking back on it, several members of our group had actually read some Elias' work, which was predominantly focused on investigating occult death cults. He went on to tell us that he was investigating Larkin and his strange story regarding the pyramid. He pointed out that the two items Larkin had produced couldn’t possibly be from the same site, as one (the cup) was Incan and from the 15th century, while the pendant was from around the 5th century. Elias told us that he’d been looking into Larkin for a while at this point, and that he’d found traces of a centuries-old death cult near Lake Titicaca (which is quite near Puno and the site of the ruins). Apparently, on his previous expedition Larkin had attempted to hire locals from Puno to venture into the temple, however they refused because of stories of a local creature called a kharisiri, which evidently is some kind of fat-sucking devil. Discussing the ramifications of all this, we decided that we couldn’t possibly take Larkin at his word at this point. We decided that it would be best to perform some of our own research by heading to the archaeological museum in the morning. We made plans to meet Elias there and went to bed.

A Trip to the Museum Fortunately for us, just down the road a ways from our hotel was the Museo de Arqueologia y Antropologia, so following breakfast we reconvened there at the office of Prof. Sanchez, a friend and contact of Elias. Sanchez told us a curious story: evidently he had, upon reading the story of Larkin’s planned expedition, reached out to try and lend his expertise to the project. Rather than hire on one of the leading experts (someone I would surely like to have along, were I planning an archaeological excavation) Larkin had rebuffed Sanchez’s efforts regarding the pyramid. We spent some time discussing the ruins and querying Sanchez about them, and he told us about recovering a journal written by a conquistador which speaks of something very similar and may reveal its location. Sanchez’s assistant, Trinidad Rizo, had just went down to the storeroom to locate the journal, but had been gone for some time, so Arthur and I decided to go check on her. Downstairs, we found the door to the storeroom ajar, and upon investigating we discovered the emaciated body of a young woman, missing a palm-sized disk of flesh from her abdomen. She had fallen in the storeroom and been covered by a moderate amount of clutter, and in her fall had broken open a wooden crate packed with straw. We couldn’t help but notice (as we moved Rizo’s body while investigating) the large piece of worked gold inlaid with geometric patterns that was poking out of the box, so naturally we collected it. Looking around, Arthur located a trail of bloody footprints and we followed them out to the street, where suddenly we heard a loud bang and the screams of passersby trying to get away from a vehicle which had suddenly caught fire. Continuing onward we followed the trail out the back exit to the street, and then around the building to the window from Sanchez’s office where it ended. Not knowing anywhere else to go, we went back inside to discuss events with our companions. We showed them the 2ft rod of gold, and then began deciphering Rizo’s notebook. The notebook told the harrowing tale of a conquistador named Gaspar de Figueroa, who had come to Peru in the company of Pizarro and also joined by four others: Hernando Ruiz, Diego Garrida, Luis de Mendoza, and Pedro de Velasco. Everyone in the room sat up with a strange look when we read the third name - surely this could not be the same man we had met the night before?

The Obligatory Trip to the Library Not able to determine anything further at the museum but simultaneously feeling that we did not know enough yet, we decided to go to the local library to see what we could turn up. While I searched in vain for a text about the history of the local area, the others in the group found a document tying Figueroa to a Padre de los Gusanos, and Sanchez managed to piece together the location to the pyramid, south of Puno. We decided as a group to prepare as rapidly as we could and depart Lima ahead of Larkin. If we could get to the ruins ahead of him, we could perhaps head off whatever strange plot he had concocted. That settled, we divided up tasks and set about gathering supplies for the journey.

Confronting him, he made vaguely threatening statements to us, in particular saying that he “always looks in on anyone working with the master”, whatever that means.

A character’s attack roll boils down to: 1d20 + Proficiency bonus + attribute modifier + magic bonus + situational bonus This is essentially what it’s been since 3rd edition came out (though we called it Base Attack Bonus back then). The big change has been the rate at which these different numbers change. The attribute modifier is mostly about the same, however in 5e there is a hard maximum that did not exist in 3.x, meaning that a similar 3.x character might have another point or two from attribute modifiers. Similarly, magic item bonuses from weapons are roughly similar, though the 3.x values tended to be a bit higher. Where you see the big difference is in proficiency bonuses and magic/situational bonuses. A 5th edition PC’s proficiency bonus starts at +2 and goes to +6, while a 3rd edition PC’s base attack bonus ranges from +0 all the way to +20 (depending on class selection). A 3rd edition PC generally has access to far more magic items that affect attacks than a 5th edition PC. This is for a couple of reasons: 5th edition has attunement requirements for many items (particularly ones which impact attack rolls), 5e’s treasure tables give out way fewer items overall, and it regularly gives advantage or disadvantage rather than a strict modifier to the roll. A 3rd edition PC has many ways to stack up situational bonuses that are typically not available to a 5e PC. These are things like flanking (which gave +2 to attack instead of advantage), charging, feats, spell effects, and so on. Many things that gave small modifiers in 3.x give advantage in 5e. The net effect here is that in 3rd edition, the range of values from an attack roll was quite large, while in 5th edition it doesn’t change too much. In 3rd edition, a low-level challenge such as a goblin or kobold was simply not a threat at high levels, as you only missed if you rolled a 1 and it only hit you if it rolled a 20. The same situation is much more threatening and challenging in 5th edition: if your AC has only increased by +3, then the goblin is only 15% less likely to hit you. If your attack bonus has increased +5 (which is a really huge amount in 5e) you are still only 25% more likely to hit a goblin. The impact on the game? Goblins (and kobolds, and orcs, and so on) are still meaningful threats at higher-level play, when in 3rd edition they weren’t even speed bumps. This is pretty cool!

Especially if we take a look at what monsters in 4th edition looked like, it seems like enemies not only have a lot less variety, but also that they are generally less interesting. I think this may be a result of trying to keep enemies relevant across many levels? Anyways, let’s take a look at derro in 5e: AC 13 3 HD Advantage on saves against spells Melee: hooked spear, +2 to hit, 1d6 damage, can knock the target prone Ranged: light crossbow, +4 to hit, 1d8+2 damage Let’s look at what Keith Ammann has to say about Derro over at The Monsters Know: With high Dexterity and above-average Constitution but merely average Strength, derro are skirmishers, but not especially mobile ones. Their Intelligence is average, but their Wisdom, for some reason, is in the cellar. This is unusual; the reverse is far more common, especially since Wisdom supports the Perception skill. Not only are they easy to get the drop on, they also have an underdeveloped survival instinct, making them more likely to fight to the death. They are, however, proficient in Stealth, predisposing them toward an ambush strategy. Look, this is a boring enemy. And while that’s fine, not every enemy is going to be all that interesting, this is still the foot soldier for this faction. Speaking of factions, the other kind of derro is a savant, who is a 5th level spellcaster with 8HD and AC 13. One challenging thing here is that derro have CR 1/4 and the derro savant has lightning bolt so it can be challenging to thread the needle of appropriate danger for your party (if you are worried about that sort of thing). The bigger issue is that there’s not a lot going on here. There are two kinds of derro, the kind that are easy to surprise and weak and the kind that cast lightning bolt and are weak. So tactically speaking they’re somewhat boring. But the bigger issue here is that they are essentially a monoculture, they’re cookie-cutter by nature. I’d like to have my PC’s face enemies that impart a sense of believability. Intelligent creatures (like derro, goblins, or any other kind of traditional enemy like that) are not going to conform to descriptions like this. There has to be more going on, doesn’t there?

So what do I think we should do instead? Is there a better way to handle intelligent enemies? Isn’t this how we’ve been playing D\u0026D for 50 years? Well, yes and no. It is mostly how we’ve been playing, certainly since the late 80s when I first played. But there was a period of time when enemy design was quite a bit more interesting. Take a look at the derro from 4th edition Monster Manual 3: Role Attacks Special Artillery Hand crossbow, dagger Bolt spray close AoE, +2d6 damage w/advantage Minion Club Suicide to turn miss into a hit Skirmisher Battleaxe -2 attack/+2d6 damage when bloodied, free attack if opponent bloodied Lurker War pick move and hide as an action, knock target unconscious if hidden as an action, shackle a target as an action, +2d6 damage w/advantage Soldier Spear, punch knock target prone as minor action Controller Scourge, psychic scourge (ranged) creates a lasting AoE centered on an ally, push all creatures within AoE as minor action Brute bite, tentacle flailing tentacle (AoE, must be bloodied), constant AoE damage If you’re unfamiliar with how 4th edition worked, this probably looks strange. The basic idea is that characters (player and otherwise) filled certain reasonably-well-defined combat roles that informed the sorts of things they did. The derro in 4th edition are much higher level but we can see from this list that they all do something interesting, they have attacks that are mostly different from each other, and when they bring special abilities into play they create really interesting enemy variety. What I find really appealing about this method of enemy design is that you really don’t need any more details to get a pretty decent understanding of how a fight with these folks is going to go down: The brute is going to wade into the thickest clump of enemies and try and get everyone in range of its AoE tentacle attacks The soldiers will try to create a sort of front line and knock enemies prone to grant advantage to their allies The artillery (personally I would’ve chosen archer as the name) has a hand crossbow so they’ll try to maneuver into a position to hit as many enemies as possible with their bolt spray attack. The lurkers do a crapload of damage if they’re able to get advantage, and they have the ability to eliminate individual targets, so they’ll sneak around and attack the lfnaks The controller will put their zone ability on the most convenient ally and then move enemies around to create advantages for their side So if we imagine our PC’s fighting against a lot of derro (they’re clearing out a fort, for instance) they’ll experience a lot of different encounters. Of course you’re not going to get a huge mix of all of these different enemy types in every group, most will be soldiers and artillery probably, but even just that small change makes a huge difference.

We’ll stick to just tweaking stats and modifying equipment because we don’t want to change their CR. And we’ll leave the savant alone for now. Let’s take the regular derro and create a soldier version. The original version is already a pretty decent archer so we’ll have it lose the spear and use a dagger instead. On top of that we’ll tweak its stats a little bit by reducing its constitution and bumping its dexterity. For the soldier, we’ll tweak the stats a bit. They’ve got a bit more strength and a bit less dexterity and intelligence (smart and nimble derro don’t get into melee combat, after all). They’ve got chain shirts instead of leather armor and javelins instead of a crossbow. Trait Archer Soldier Strength: 10 13 Dexterity: 14 12 Intelligence: 11 8 Constitution: 10 12 AC: 13 14 Attacks: Dagger +2/1d6, crossbow +4/1d8+2 Hooked spear +3/1d6+1 This is a pretty small set of changes, but the result is a clear differentiation between different groups of enemies. When your PC’s see these derro, you can describe the archers as small, nimble-looking crossbow wielders wearing leather armor, who scamper around and keep their distance. The soldiers, in comparison, look like absolute hulks, wearing chain shirts and wielding spears. In combat we haven’t really changed their overall capabilities very much (since we haven’t added any new attacks or actions), we’ve just divided the group up. Now your players can look at their enemies and intuit their behavior based on their appearance and their equipment. This makes the encounter more interesting, and it makes it more rewarding when the players win.

If we really want to instill character into our enemies we can go much further, by adding new actions and capabilities. This is difficult at low level because your PC’s aren’t very powerful, but as they gain levels you can do things like give certain enemy types damage resistances that others don’t have, feats, significantly better equipment variation, and so on.

Glaeyn Dominant language in Glaeyd Strium2, used in forest and diverse cultures. A lilting and musical language much like elvish. Mashid Primary/aristocratic language in the Mashioque Dynasty3. An ancient language that hasn’t changed much in centuries. Anywhere outside the Dynasty, it’s considered needlessly formal and is only spoken by academics or privately tutored students, that sort of thing. Rhurin Commoner language in the Mashioque Dynasty. This language descended from the non-Dragonborn inhabitants of the mountains in easter Yeileth, so it is identified with dwarves, goblins, and other miner types. Sounds a lot like Klingon. Eopian Spoken in the plains in eastern Yeileth4. The people who live in the grasslands and foothills of eastern Yeileth are considered more cosmopolitan, engaging in frequent trade with the Free Cities and the Dynasty. More recently, the Dynasty has claimed some of this territory, resulting in this language becoming associated with the Mashioque Army. Ghikrali Spoken in the plains in southwestern Yeileth. The plains south of Glaed Strium are a vast sea of grasslands with very little to break it up. Not very many people leave here. Niovarin Used broadly by the underground cultures of Yeileth, in both Glaeyd Strium and the Mashioque Dynasty. We haven’t explored the underdark much, but if there were an undercommon, this would be it. Azish Used in the mountains in central Eryssia. Viewed as a sort of hillbilly tongue in Alcona5, it is either a point of pride (among the goliaths and orcs who speak it) or derision (from the elves in the capital). Ionqali Used by nearly all seagoing people in the Western Bay. This is something akin a trade tongue, used by Free Cities traders, tritons, and humans from Corus alike. Utlun A local language used in the swamps and coasts of southern Eryssia. Another hillbilly language, spoken by gnolls and lizardfolk who are looked down on by the elves in the capital. Euklish The main language of the Free Cities of Mihira. Each of the Free Cities is an independent nation by law, and they all have a distinct culture and set of languages.

That isn’t the case in Sinath Lonn. There are basically two types of gods in this world. The first are patron gods, and they are typically concerned with an individual race such as elves or orcs. The second are greater gods, who get involved in things that they care about in somewhat fickle and inconsistent ways. Note I’ve obviously lifted all of these straight out of existing settings.

They are a cleric of law and order, and are seeking their life’s purpose. Zo-zu, a human/goblin artificer from the Empire of Corus.

Previous party members: Lein, a tortle monk from Glaeyd Strium, died from a derro hook spear to the head while pacifying a temple to Bha’al. Ashal, a leonin fighter from the plains of the Mashioque Dynasty, died when overrun by angry blights animated to defend the Ellisdeen Wilds. The party has been on a quest to retrieve a mysterious artifact, the Heart of the Forest, and return it to its rightful place in the far northeast part of the Ellisdeen Wilds. In our most recent session they have found the temple to return the heart, only to discover it is some kind of ancient technology. They attempted to replace the heart in its sarcophagus but failed to realize that the apparatus had been damaged when it was stolen. This caused the replacement to go awry and the installation defenses triggered. One of the bugbear allies stayed behind to buy the party time to escape, and we have not yet seen the fallout of this.

This will probably be limited mostly to gaming and tech since those are the things I generally feel the safest sharing with others, but who knows? A bit about me: I’m a cis white 18-49 American. My pronouns are he/him/his. I consider myself on the far left side of the political spectrum. I plan to use this site to chat about my hobbies: I’ve been playing and running various RPG’s since the 90s. Mostly this has been D\u0026D/Pathfinder, but I have also enjoyed (in no particular order) Traveller, World of Darkness, Brave New World, GURPS, and a litany of other games. More recently I’ve been digging into the OSR and am starting an Old School Essentials game. I play video games also. My steam library is extensive. I tend to refrain from competitive multiplayer games and usually enjoy CRPG’s, strategy, and narrative-first games, although a decade or so ago I played a lot of Battlefield. I watch a fair amount of TV and movies and might talk about them. I like tech and enjoy setting up a relatively sophisticated home network. I try to self-host anything I can and intend to share some of what I’ve learned. Things you won’t find here: Support for cops, Nazis, or gender roles.
