# Waterdeep Dragon Heist


I'm running [Waterdeep Dragon Heist](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=waterdeep+dragon+heist&ia=web)
using the [Alexandrian Remix](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/41217/roleplaying-games/dragon-heist-remix-part-1-the-villains)
for a group of inexperienced players.

The party:

* Blackberry Rabbitfoot, a halfling rogue. Of the six attack rolls she has made,
    4 have been critical hits. She steals everything that isn't nailed down.
* Sanghorn, an aasimar monk. He's thought he was human his whole life, but
    recently started hearing from a spirit in his head, and has come to
    Waterdeep to find out what this means.
* Tirsa, a satyr bard. We don't know a ton about her yet, but she loves to play
    tricks on people and use her wiles to have her way.
* Sgawl, a gnome sorcerer. They're very quiet but are able to unleash a
    significant amount of arcane power. They're somewhat grown over with moss,
    like Radagast.

The party is midway through chapter one.
