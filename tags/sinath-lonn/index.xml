            </div>Drawing from other games, let's take a look at revamping the health system in D&D 5E. We'll raise the stakes by increasing lethality and creating wound effects which have lasting effects on a character, while at the same time we'll avoid turning the game into a misery simulator by maintaining a sense of cinematic combat.]]></description></item><item><title>Languages in Sinath Lonn</title><link>https://www.lordyod.com/languages/</link><pubDate>Fri, 15 Oct 2021 17:40:55 -0700</pubDate><author>blog@lordyod.com</author><dc:creator>Lord Yod</dc:creator><guid>https://www.lordyod.com/languages/</guid><description><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m not a fan of the common tongue in D&amp;D.
