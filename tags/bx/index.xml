We&rsquo;re starting with the Classic ruleset, 3d6 in order. It&rsquo;s likely to be a very high-stakes game and this&rsquo;ll probably be a rude awakening for some of the players as they&rsquo;ve only had experience with 5e.
The party consists of a dwarf, a thief, a fighter, and two magic-users. So far the only thing we&rsquo;ve done is a session zero, it&rsquo;s scheduled to start next week.]]></description></item><item><title>Current RPGs</title><link>https://www.lordyod.com/current-rpgs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 Oct 2021 14:31:55 -0700</pubDate><author>blog@lordyod.com</author><dc:creator>Lord Yod</dc:creator><guid>https://www.lordyod.com/current-rpgs/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ll try to keep this post updated with a list of the games I&amp;rsquo;m currently running or playing in.
Playing Radiant Gaia: an open table 5th Edition D&amp;amp;D game set in a homebrew world, the players (mostly) come from an underground realm called Terra and are sent on expeditions to explore Gaia by a patron. I play Beatrix the Monolith, a half-orc Grey Watchman Warden. This game is run by Sammy who I met through the wonderful Alexandrian Discord.</description></item></channel></rss>
