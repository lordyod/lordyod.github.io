The party:
Blackberry Rabbitfoot, a halfling rogue. Of the six attack rolls she has made, 4 have been critical hits. She steals everything that isn&amp;rsquo;t nailed down. Sanghorn, an aasimar monk.

Playing Radiant Gaia: an open table 5th Edition D&amp;amp;D game set in a homebrew world, the players (mostly) come from an underground realm called Terra and are sent on expeditions to explore Gaia by a patron. I play Beatrix the Monolith, a half-orc Grey Watchman Warden. This game is run by Sammy who I met through the wonderful Alexandrian Discord.</description></item></channel></rss>
