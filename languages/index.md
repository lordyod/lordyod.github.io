# Languages in Sinath Lonn


I'm not a fan of the common tongue in D&D. The fact that most settings have a
language that everybody just speaks seems really off to me. I thought about this
while reading what Sam wrote at [Caput Caprae](https://caput-caprae.blogspot.com/2021/10/language-for-wizards.html):

## Background

I'm not an authority on languages at all so anything I try to come up with is
going to be pretty hamfisted. Here's a starting point, where certain languages
are spoken by certain cultures of people, with a fair amount of overlap between
them. The people of one nation tend to be able to talk to each other at least
well enough to do business. My goal with coming up with this list, just as with
the [gods]({{< ref "gods-of-sinath-lonn" >}}), was to put something together
relatively quickly and get it into play. I didn't want to spend a year or two
hammering out a fully detailed campaign setting when these details fundamentally
don't impact play very much. In the case of the gods, the nature of divine magic
and interaction with the world means that it doesn't really matter what their
names are at this stage in the campaign. For languages, all we really care about
is who can talk to who, not what the languages themselves are called.

## Languages

With all that out of the way, here is a list of languages with some notes on
usage based on cultural or geographic background. I'll have more to say about
both cultures and geography in the future, for now check the footnotes:

| Language | Cultural / Geographic Usage | Description |
|----------|-----------------------------|-------------|
| Eryssian | Dominant language of Eryssia[^eryssia], used in forest, plains, and diverse cultures. | The closest thing the setting has to common at this stage. Like English, it is formed by smashing together a number of other languages. |
| Glaeyn   | Dominant language in Glaeyd Strium[^glaeyd], used in forest and diverse cultures. | A lilting and musical language much like elvish. |
| Mashid   | Primary/aristocratic language in the Mashioque Dynasty[^mashioque]. | An ancient language that hasn't changed much in centuries. Anywhere outside the Dynasty, it's considered needlessly formal and is only spoken by academics or privately tutored students, that sort of thing. |
| Rhurin   | Commoner language in the Mashioque Dynasty. | This language descended from the non-Dragonborn inhabitants of the mountains in easter Yeileth, so it is identified with dwarves, goblins, and other miner types.  Sounds a lot like Klingon. |
| Eopian   | Spoken in the plains in eastern Yeileth[^yeileth]. | The people who live in the grasslands and foothills of eastern Yeileth are considered more cosmopolitan, engaging in frequent trade with the Free Cities and the Dynasty.  More recently, the Dynasty has claimed some of this territory, resulting in this language becoming associated with the Mashioque Army. |
| Ghikrali | Spoken in the plains in southwestern Yeileth. | The plains south of Glaed Strium are a vast sea of grasslands with very little to break it up. Not very many people leave here. |
| Niovarin | Used broadly by the underground cultures of Yeileth, in both Glaeyd Strium and the Mashioque Dynasty. | We haven't explored the underdark much, but if there were an undercommon, this would be it. |
| Azish    | Used in the mountains in central Eryssia. | Viewed as a sort of hillbilly tongue in Alcona[^alcona], it is either a point of pride (among the goliaths and orcs who speak it) or derision (from the elves in the capital). |
| Ionqali  | Used by nearly all seagoing people in the Western Bay. | This is something akin a trade tongue, used by Free Cities traders, tritons, and humans from Corus alike. |
| Utlun    | A local language used in the swamps and coasts of southern Eryssia.  | Another hillbilly language, spoken by gnolls and lizardfolk who are looked down on by the elves in the capital. |
| Euklish  | The main language of the Free Cities of Mihira. | Each of the Free Cities is an independent nation by law, and they all have a distinct culture and set of languages. That said, anybody who's anybody in Mihira speaks Euklish. |
| Omesh    | A language from somewhere far to the east. | The PCs have no idea where this language is spoken.[^aleki] |
| Orosa    | The main language of the Empire of Corus.[^corus] | There are many more languages in the Empire, but this is the official one. It's quite similar to German. |

## Communicating despite language barriers

For ease of play in the new setting, each of the PC's spoke Eryssian when we
started. It probably would've been more fun to enforce some kind of background
restriction but since we are playing virtually I wanted it to be workable. The
party has met a few groups who don't speak Eryssian so far, and it's been
interesting working out areas of overlap. Most anyone who grew up in a diverse
culture (or near a coastline) speaks at least a few words of Ionqali, and anyone
from around the Dynasty probably knows enough Eopian and Rhurin to order dinner,
for instance.

[^eryssia]: An island subcontinent, roughly the size of Texas, situated in the
  center of the Western Bay region. The campaign started in western Eryssia.

[^glaeyd]: A nation in western Yeileth, on the north side of the Western Bay
  region. You can think of it as your typical Tolkien-esque elven kingdom and
  not be far off.

[^mashioque]: A nation covering most of northeastern Yeileth, with lots of
  mountains and natural resources. Very stratified society with a powerful
  aristocracy of Dragonborn houses.

[^yeileth]: Yeileth is a huge continent, making up the northern and eastern
  borders of the Western Bay. It is dominated by Glaeyd Strium in the northwest,
  the Mashioque Dynasty in the northeast, and the Free Cities of Mihira in the
  southeast.

[^alcona]: The major kingdom in Eryssia, once a powerful elven monarchy but now
  on the decline under a weak regency. The setting for the campaign.

[^corus]: The Empire of Corus is metropolitan, diverse, and made up almost entirely
  of humans. From the small peninsula of Iyush, west of Eryssia. Fantastical
  tales of flying carriages and buildings a mile tall can't possibly be true,
  can they?
