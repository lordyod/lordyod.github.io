# Hot Springs Island


I'm running the [Hot Springs Island](https://swordfishislands.itch.io/hot-springs-island)
sandbox campaign by Jacob Hurst, using the [Old School Essentials](https://necroticgnome.com/)
ruleset.

We're starting with the _Classic_ ruleset, 3d6 in order. It's likely to be a
very high-stakes game and this'll probably be a rude awakening for some of the
players as they've only had experience with 5e.

The party consists of a dwarf, a thief, a fighter, and two magic-users. So far
the only thing we've done is a session zero, it's scheduled to start next week.
