# Current RPGs


I'll try to keep this post updated with a list of the games I'm currently
running or playing in.

## Playing

* **Radiant Gaia:** an [open table](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/38643/roleplaying-games/open-table-manifesto)
    5th Edition D\&D game set in a homebrew world, the players (mostly) come
    from an underground realm called *Terra* and are sent on expeditions to
    explore *Gaia* by a patron. I play [Beatrix the Monolith]({{< ref "/tags/beatrix/" >}}),
    a half-orc [Grey Watchman Warden](https://mfov.magehandpress.com/2016/12/warden.html).
    This game is run by Sammy who I met through the wonderful
    [Alexandrian](https://thealexandrian.net/) Discord.
* **Mutant Marches:** a [West Marches](https://arsludi.lamemage.com/index.php/78/grand-experiments-west-marches/)
    game using [Mutant Crawl Classics](https://goodman-games.com/store/mutant-crawl-classics/),
    the PCs are 'seekers' from a small village which suffered a catastrophe
    and lost its communal records of the surrounding region. They send
    expeditions out in search of resources, allies, and artifacts of the
    Ancients. It's run by Darren (who I also met through the Alexandrian
    Discord).

## Running

* **[Sinath Lonn]({{< ref "/tags/sinath-lonn/" >}}):** a science-fantasy
    homebrew setting using some heavily-modified 5th Edition rules, this is a
    really big sandbox game.
* **[Waterdeep Dragon Heist]({{< ref "/tags/wdh/" >}}):** I'm using the
    incredible [Alexandrian Remix](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/41217/roleplaying-games/dragon-heist-remix-part-1-the-villains)
    to run the published campaign as a gentle introduction to D\&D for some
    players who have basically never played before.
* **[Hot Springs Island]({{< ref "/tags/hsi/" >}}):**
    [This module](https://swordfishislands.itch.io/hot-springs-island)
    by Jacob Hurst is simply incredible. It's system agnostic so I'm taking
    the opportunity to get into old-school D\&D with the
    [Old School Essentials](https://necroticgnome.com/) retroclone.
