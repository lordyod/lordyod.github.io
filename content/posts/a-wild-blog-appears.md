Hi, I'm Yod. I'm starting this blog to share some thoughts on my interests.
This will probably be limited mostly to gaming and tech since those are the
things I generally feel the safest sharing with others, but who knows?

A bit about me:

* I'm a cis white 18-49 American.
* My pronouns are he/him/his.
* I consider myself on the far left side of the political spectrum.

I plan to use this site to chat about my hobbies:

* I've been playing and running various [RPG's]({{< ref "/categories/rpg/" >}})
    since the 90s. Mostly this has been
    D\&D/Pathfinder, but I have also enjoyed (in no particular order)
    Traveller, World of Darkness, Brave New World, GURPS, and a litany of
    other games. More recently I've been digging into the OSR and am starting
    an Old School Essentials game.
* I play video games also. My steam library is extensive. I tend to refrain from
    competitive multiplayer games and usually enjoy CRPG's, strategy, and
    narrative-first games, although a decade or so ago I played a lot of
    Battlefield.
* I watch a fair amount of TV and movies and might talk about them.
* I like tech and enjoy setting up a relatively sophisticated home network. I
    try to self-host anything I can and intend to share some of what I've
    learned.

Things you won't find here:

* Support for cops, Nazis, or gender roles.
